A Rust-based parametric Finite Element Analysis tool for Direct Parameterisation of Invariant Manifolds (e.g., Spectral Submanifolds) in geometrically nonlinear structural dynamics. Enables high-dimensional model order reduction by assembling matrices polynomially parameterised by mesh geometry and material properties.
